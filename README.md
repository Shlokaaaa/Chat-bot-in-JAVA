A chatbot or chatterbot or AI assistant is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text.    Here we have written the code in Java and have implemented a menu/ button based chatbot. Certain functions are already fed to the chat bot and depending on the input of the user it gives the appropriate output. 

FUNCTIONALITIES IMPLEMENTED
1. Sending live image
One device is made the server and other is made server. The server, after getting command from the user, clicks a picture and sends it to the client. 
Byteoutputstream in java.io is used here.

2. Inter device communication/ chatting
Likewise, here the server and client can communicate with each other.
Socket programming is used here. 

3. Opening a URL
Using this command the user can open Google, Gmail, Netflix and such sites.
desk.browser

4. Play music 
Through this command user can play a song that is already downloaded in the system.
AudioPlayer.player.start is used by importing sun.audio

5. Play game
User can also play game of tic-tac-toe in the console

6. Random fact
A random fact will pop up on the console 

7. Set timer
8User can set the timer for a specific period of time and after the time is up, an audio will start playing. 
AudioPlayer.player.start is used by importing sun.audio.

8. Calendar
Calendar will be displayed in the console
java.util.Locale is used here.

9. Text to speech
Text entered by user is dictated by the bot.
javax.speech.Central and javax.speech.synthesis.Synthesizer are used to achieve this.

CONCEPTS USED
The concepts that we have implemented in the code are:
1. String functions
2. String buffer
3. Methods/ classes/ objects/ constructors
4. Parameterized methods and constructors
5. Exception handling
6. Inheritance
7. Using pre defined classes like
    java.util.Locale, java.time (for calendar and time)
    java.awt.Desktop (for accessing files on desktop)
    java.net (for URL access)
    javax.speech.Central (for text to speech)
